## ECDSA Node

This project is an example of using a client and server to facilitate transfers between different addresses. Since there is just a single server on the back-end handling transfers, this is clearly very centralized. We won't worry about distributed consensus for this project.

However, something that we would like to incoporate is Public Key Cryptography. By using Elliptic Curve Digital Signatures we can make it so the server only allows transfers that have been signed for by the person who owns the associated address.

### Client

The client folder contains a [react app](https://reactjs.org/) using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/). To get started, follow these steps:

1. Open up a terminal in the `/client` folder
2. Run `npm install` to install all the depedencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the application 
4. Now you should be able to visit the app at http://127.0.0.1:5173/

### Server

The server folder contains a node.js server using [express](https://expressjs.com/). To run the server, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal within the `/server` folder 
2. Run `npm install` to install all the depedencies 
3. Run `node index` to start the server 

The application should connect to the default server port (3042) automatically! 

_Hint_ - Use [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) instead of `node` to automatically restart the server on any changes.

### Work done

## The objectif

The goal was to add a simple authentication system with Elliptic Curve Digital Signatures as Public Key Cryptography.

## Result

First, I added a script to test and create users:
`node server/scripts/generate.js`

Then 3 users were add to the project with their private key, public key, address (20 last bit of public key). To list them you can use:
`node server/scripts/users.js`
You will also see a message and a signature of this message. 

Now the server is checking that you are the good user because you have to provide both the address AND a digital signature of a message (the message is hard coded in the code: "Hey, it's me."). The server will:
1. Get the corresponding public key of the address you provided
2. Get your digital signature of the "Hey, it's me."
3. Check with the `verify` fonction if your digital signature has been generated by the corresponding private key (so it's means you own the private key otherwise you would not have been able to create this signature)
4. Allow you the access of your balance and allow you to transfer some found.

So now, to use the project you have give the address of one the 3 users and it corresponding signature to show that you possess the private key.

Note: you can transfer to who you want but you will not be able to see it because if the account is not one of the 3 given, you won't have the digital signature...
